# eccomerce_website
A full-stack e-commerce platform built with Next.js, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, designed to deliver a seamless shopping experience for users and powerful management tools for administrators.
E-Commerce Website

This is a simple full-stack e-commerce website built as part of my learning and lab project. The goal of the project is to understand how real online stores work—from the frontend interface to backend APIs and database management.

About the Project

The site will include basic e-commerce features such as:

Browsing products

Adding items to the cart

Checkout flow

User login and registration

Admin control for managing products

The project is still in progress and will be improved as I continue learning.

Tech Stack

Frontend: Next.js, CSS
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
Security: JWT Authentication
Tools: Git, GitHub, Postman, VS Code

What I’m Trying to Achieve

The purpose of this project is to practice full-stack development by building something practical. I want to learn how to:

Connect the frontend to backend APIs

Handle user authentication

Structure a real working database

Build clean and reusable components

Manage simple e-commerce logic like carts and orders

Features (Planned and Completed)

Product list page

Product details

Add to cart

Checkout

User login & signup

Admin panel for managing products

REST API with Node.js and Express.js

MongoDB data models

More features will be added as the project grows.

Current Status

This is a lab/project-in-progress, and I’m using it to improve my skills and understand full-stack workflows better.
